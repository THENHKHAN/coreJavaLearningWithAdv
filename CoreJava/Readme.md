A month ago, I struggled with even the simplest questions, but now I can tackle medium-level problems. `The only reason for this progress is that I stayed consistent`. If I didn’t know an answer, I watched a tutorial or two, asked ChatGPT for help—but I never stopped trying. `Following a pattern-based approach` really helped, too. I was so damn disciplined, working 12/13 hrs a day.
