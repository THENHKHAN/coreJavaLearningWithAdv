### <div style="text-align: center;"> Insertion Sort ALGO </div>
* The Insertion Sort algorithm uses one part of the array to hold the sorted values, and the other part of the array to hold values that are not sorted yet.
* The algorithm takes one value at a time from the unsorted part of the array and puts it into the right place in the sorted part of the array, until the array is sorted.
* #### How it works: [w3School](https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_algo_insertionsort.php)<br>
  * Take the first value from the unsorted part of the array.
  * Move the value into the correct place in the sorted part of the array.
  * Go through the unsorted part of the array again as many times as there are values.

* ###  When to use???
    * Used for smaller value of N.
    * Array is partially sorted.
    * It takes part in hybrid sorting algo.
