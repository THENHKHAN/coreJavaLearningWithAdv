### <div style="text-align: left;"> Pattern of Cyclic SOrt algo use (type-2 [0 n] or [1 n]) </div>
The **cyclic sort concept** is particularly well-suited for problems that involve finding the smallest missing positive
integer because it _`allows us to place each element in its correct position in the array without needing extra space`_
or additional sorting algorithms. The **intuition behind using cyclic sort** here is to `leverage the index-based mapping`
and `directly place each element in its "correct" index`, which corresponds to the number itself.
