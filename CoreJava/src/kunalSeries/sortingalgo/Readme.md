* `NOTE`: Will be learning `Merge Sort` and `Quick Sort` in `Recursion` topic. <br>
* In every sorting algo, will be sorting step by step.
* They will be differed by each step(`what are they doing`).This is what make all the Algo different from each other.

### <div style="text-align: left;"> Bubble Sort </div>
* It is a `Comparison sort` method.
* `Compares adjacent` elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order
* Think of it as "bubbling up" the largest elements to the top (or end) of the list in each pass.
* ### Key Points: <br>
  *  It compares two adjacent elements and swaps them if needed.
  *    After each pass, the `largest unsorted element moves to its correct position.`
  *   It keeps sorting until no swaps are needed.
