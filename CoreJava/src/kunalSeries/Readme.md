### <div style="text-align: left;"> Useful Tips During Lecture: </div>
* Don't spend more than `30min` to solving single problem. Go for others approach(for `LC`- go discussion section or `google`) and hint and then come back
* if you didn't completely satisfy after looking and then solve `BOOKMARK it` and Revisit after 2 week.
* When you are solving problem then `Try to remember the pattern` of which are using to solve that problem. What type of problem of topic is solved by which type of pattern and how `Optimized`.`Ex`: topic-array : two pointer, sliding window etc.
* Following a pattern-based approach, it would be really helpful for solving n number of questions.
