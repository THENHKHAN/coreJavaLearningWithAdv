### <div style="text-align: left;"> How to Print Patterns in Java? </div>
Printing patterns in Java is a common exercise for beginners. Patterns are designs made by `arranging symbols or numbers in a specific way`. This task `helps you understand loops and control statements`, which are fundamental concepts in programming.
Patterns can be simple, like a pyramid, or more complex, like a pyramid of numbers. Learning to print these patterns helps improve your problem solving skills.

In Java, loops and control statements are used to print patterns. Loops repeat a block of code multiple times, and control statements let you make decisions in your code.


#### Steps to Solve
1. **Understand the Pattern**: <br>
   Analyze the pattern to `understand the relation between the row numbers and the number of stars in each row`. In this example, the number of stars in each row equals the row number(square pattern).

2. **Initialize the Loop for Rows:** <br>
   Use a loop to iterate through the rows. The _number of iterations should equal the number of rows in the pattern_.
    
3. **Nested Loop for Printing Stars:** <br>
   Inside the loop for rows, use another loop to print stars in each row. The number of stars is equal to the current row number(square pattern).

4. **Move to the Next Line After Printing Stars in a Row:**
   After printing stars in a row, print a newline character to move to the next row.
