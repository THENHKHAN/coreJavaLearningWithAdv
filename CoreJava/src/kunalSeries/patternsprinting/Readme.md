### <div style="text-align: left;"> How to Print Patterns in Java? </div>
Printing patterns in Java is a common exercise for beginners. Patterns are designs made by `arranging symbols or numbers in a specific way`. This task `helps you understand loops and control statements`, which are fundamental concepts in programming.
Patterns can be simple, like a pyramid, or more complex, like a pyramid of numbers. Learning to print these patterns helps improve your problem solving skills.

In Java, loops and control statements are used to print patterns. Loops repeat a block of code multiple times, and control statements let you make decisions in your code.
