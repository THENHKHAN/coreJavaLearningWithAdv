### <div style="text-align: left;"> How to Print Patterns in Java? </div>
Printing patterns in Java is a common exercise for beginners. Patterns are designs made by `arranging symbols or numbers in a specific way`. This task `helps you understand loops and control statements`, which are fundamental concepts in programming.
Patterns can be simple, like a pyramid, or more complex, like a pyramid of numbers. Learning to print these patterns helps improve your problem solving skills.

In Java, loops and control statements are used to print patterns. Loops repeat a block of code multiple times, and control statements let you make decisions in your code.


#### Steps to Solve
1. **Understand the Pattern**: <br>
   Analyze the pattern to understand the relation between the row numbers and the number of stars in each row. In this example, the number of stars in each row equals the row number.

2. **Initialize the Loop for Rows:** <br>
   Use a loop to iterate through the rows. The number of iterations should equal the number of rows in the pattern.
    
3. **Nested Loop for Printing Stars:** <br>
   Inside the loop for rows, use another loop to print stars in each row. The number of stars is equal to the current row number.

4. **Move to the Next Line After Printing Stars in a Row:**
   After printing stars in a row, print a newline character to move to the next row.
